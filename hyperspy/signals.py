The Signal class and its specilized subclasses:

    Signal
        For generic data with arbitrary signal_dimension. All other signal
        classes inherit from this one. It should only be used with none of
        the others is appropriated.
    Spectrum
        For generic data with signal_dimension equal 1, i.e. spectral data of
        n-dimensions. The signal is unbinned by default.
    Image
        For generic data with signal_dimension equal 2, i.e. image data of
        n-dimensions. The signal is unbinned by default.
    Simulation
        For generic simulated data with arbitrary signal_dimension. All other
        simulation signal classes inherit from this one. It should only be used
        with none of the others is appropriated.
    EELSSpectrum
        For electron energy-loss data with signal_dimension equal 1, i.e.
        spectral data of n-dimensions. The signal is binned by default.
    EELSSpectrumSimulation, SpectrumSimulation, ImageSimulation
        Simulation versions of EELSSpectrum, Spectrum and Image.
    EDSTEMSpectrum
        For electron energy-dispersive X-rays data acquired in a transmission
        electron microscopy with signal_dimension equal 1, i.e.
        spectral data of n-dimensions. The signal is binned by default.
    EDSSEMSpectrum
        For electron energy-dispersive X-rays data acquired in a scanning
        electron microscopy with signal_dimension equal 1, i.e.
        spectral data of n-dimensions. The signal is binned by default.
    DielectricFunction
        For dielectric function data with signal_dimension equal 1. The signal
        is unbinned by default.
